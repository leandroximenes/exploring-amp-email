    <h2>Hello, Leandro</h2>

    <div>
      I already have invented two things and the patents are in the works.
      <span [class]="visible ? 'show' : 'hide'" class="hide">
        However, I could invent something utterly mind-blowing and be rocketed
        off to a life of adventure. I could actually make one of the many
        devices in my portfolio real. Although, I would first have to clean up
        my desk and junk pile. I know I have useful stuff in there. I just have
        to find it.
      </span>
    </div>

    <button
      [text]="visible ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More'"
      on="tap:AMP.setState({visible: !visible})"
    >
      Show More
    </button>

    <h1>Email jokes!</h1>
    <p>
      I was going to send a joke about spam emails, but you probably wouldn't
      get it.
