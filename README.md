# Exploring AMP Email

This repo is a collection of example apps for sending different types of [AMP Email](https://amp.dev/about/email/).

## What is AMP Email?

AMP Email allows email senders to add a third MIME part on top of text and HTML to emails. This third part may contain [AMP components](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-components/) which can be used to make the email interactive and dynamic.

Interactive components include carousels and accordions. With dynamic components you can load live data from a server or submit data through a form within an email.
